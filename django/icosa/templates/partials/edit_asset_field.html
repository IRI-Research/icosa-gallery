                The reason that CC licenses are irrevocable is to protect people that have used your work. Once someone has used material under a CC license, they will always have the right to use it under thee same license terms, even if the licensor changes his or her mind and stops distributing under the CC license terms. People will often choose to respect the licensorâ€™s wishes and stop using the work if requested, but allowing creators to revoke or change licences whenever they wished would create so much uncertainty and legal risk that it would negate nearly all the benefits of Creative Commons licensing.
