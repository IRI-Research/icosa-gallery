this sucks => import {Viewer} from "/static/js/icosa-viewer.module.js?v={% now "U" %}";

log somewhere when we catch an exception falling back to gltf1: view_asset.html

Add max complexity as a search filter

orderBy is currently:
BEST, NEWEST, OLDEST. Defaults to BEST, which ranks assets
based on a combination of popularity and other features. 
We should improve this, but probably keep the existing variants working. BEST could possibly be "number of likes" or something for now.

impl nicer full-text search

we should accept snake_case and camelCase url params and do the translation. The openapi docs should list both as accepted styles. If we get both variants of the same param, just choose the value of whatever we got first.

flatten orienting rotation and presentation params into asset model and instead make a schema to return the correct format.

pagination for all front end listers
