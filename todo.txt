Add pagination UI to the home page

Add max complexity as a search filter

orderBy is currently:
BEST, NEWEST, OLDEST. Defaults to BEST, which ranks assets

We should improve this, but probably keep the existing variants working. BEST could possibly be "number of likes" or something for now.

impl nicer full-text search

devicecode needs to be a web view, not an api endpoint

check auth returns just one user when using tokens

we should accept snake_case and camelCase url params and do the translation. The openapi docs should list both as accepted styles. If we get both variants of the same param, just choose the value of whatever we got first.
