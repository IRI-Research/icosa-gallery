icosa.Asset.orienting_rotation: (fields.E010) JSONField default should be a callable instead of an instance so that it's not shared between all field instances. HINT: Use a callable instead, e.g., use `dict` instead of `{}`.

WARN[0000] The "w3r" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.

docker-compose.yml: `version` is obsolete

`formats` field formatting - assets endpoint should use the new format and the poly endpoint the old

User.url should be `unique`

this sucks => import {Viewer} from "/static/js/icosa-viewer.module.js?v={% now "U" %}";
