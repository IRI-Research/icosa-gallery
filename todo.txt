`formats` field formatting - assets endpoint should use the new format and the poly endpoint the old

this sucks => import {Viewer} from "/static/js/icosa-viewer.module.js?v={% now "U" %}";

asset and format id fields need to be snowflakes.

make icosa formats have relative urls, not the abs b2 ones we have from gcp_to_b2.py

log somewhere when we catch an exception falling back to gltf1: view_asset.html
