`formats` field formatting - all assets need poly compatible fields

this sucks => import {Viewer} from "/static/js/icosa-viewer.module.js?v={% now "U" %}";

make icosa formats have relative urls, not the abs b2 ones we have from gcp_to_b2.py

log somewhere when we catch an exception falling back to gltf1: view_asset.html

Add pagination UI to the home page

Add max complexity as a search filter

create stub users when importing poly data

impl nicer full-text search

devicecode needs to be a web view, not an api endpoint

check auth returns just one user when using tokens

we should accept snake_case and camelCase url params and do the translation. The openapi docs should list both as accepted styles. If we get both variants of the same param, just choose the value of whatever we got first.
